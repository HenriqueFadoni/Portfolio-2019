		<h1>Professional Background</h1>
		<p>
			My journey into programming began in 2011, before High School, back then I had limitless adventures creating small games in Unity 3D.
			Due to my coding passion, I did a three-year course degree in Computer Science where I learned the basic concepts in programming and in
			Web as well as Mobile Development. Since then, I had worked mainly remotely for companies in Europe and Brazil.
			I am passionate about learning new technologies and being challenged.
